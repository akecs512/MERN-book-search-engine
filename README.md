When they click on the Search for Books menu option they are presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button.
When they are not logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button then they are presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site.

## System Usage
### Styling
Styling is done through 

### VSCode Extensions
VS Code should recommend the following extensions:
- Prettier
- ESLint
- Code Spell Checker
- React JS Snippets (even though this not a React project, the `clg` snippet is just too useful not to have)


### Special Thanks
  Thanks to Adamk72 for his help cleaning up the code and helping me make it work.
